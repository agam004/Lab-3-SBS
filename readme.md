# Lab 3 (Python)

## Key Syntax observations:
    In C# we write :
                        if(statement){

                        }
                        else if (statement){

                        }
    But in python its :
                        if(statement)

                        elif(statement)//Works same as else if

    For the loop in C# : 
                            for (int i=0; i<=20 ; i++)
                            {
                                console.writeline(i);
                                i++;
                            }
    But in python we use range :
                                    for i in range(0,21)
                                    {
                                        print(i) //prints values starting from 0 upto 21 not including 21
                                    }      

### The sytax is kind of different from most programming languages as there is no semiclons on end and curly brackets {} for formatting, kind of feels incomplete while coding in starting.
